Our report suggests they have now developed the ultimate weapon - to which there is no defence and no ship can survive. This news was received mostly with scepticism by our population, with the majority believing it was a cool story fabricated by the media to keep the elites in power. As a result we will not be securing extra funding through voluntary donations to reinforce our naval forces."

At this stage we should redirect our efforts to safeguarding our achievements, as the legacy of our empire will always be under scrutiny in the history archives. Xeno historians across the galaxy will write of the §H[From.GetName]§! for centuries to come, but what about? A Galactic Ascendancy must always stand for something. With great power comes great responsibility, and having reached the zenith of civilization we should commit ourselves to a cause with total fanaticism. For that, we shall be remembered in history for eons to come."
