Concentric growth rings, sometimes containing embedded plant material, suggest that the organism grows sporadically by the addition of external layers. It is probable that the "trunks" represent the fruiting body, or "sporophore", of a fungus, which would be fuelled by a mycelium, a net of dispersed hyphae filaments."

Serving as massive bio-factories that could churn out the endless swarms of bio-lifeforms. Hive worlds as we name them seem to have been living creatures on their own, incorporating millions of bioengineered organisms. Each was a biological factory capable of creating trillions of large and small organisms, of replicating genomes and splicing together new creatures perfectly adapted for each new world and environment they are found on. We can only hope these types of creatures are no longer amongst us.."
 
 Periodic_Meteor_Showers:0 "Periodic Meteor Showers"

They are easily attracted to rhythmic vibrations on the surface, and they would breach in pursuit of the origin of such vibrations almost immediately. This seems to be an effort to defend their territory, of which they seem to be highly protective. Thus to see a worm, and live to tell about it, might be a rarity in itself. The sandworms are extremely territorial; as soon as two worms sense each others presence, they let out chuffing roars of challenge, bellowing melange-smelling exhaust from their cavernous throats. Despite all the potential danger, the spice must flow."
 
 Artificial_Core:0 "Artificial Core"
 Artificial_Core_desc:0 "This world should have died long ago after the core froze and the magnetic field died, but a massive installation in the planet's core, made by a particularly powerful precursor empire somehow keeps the core spinning and the magnetic field active."

 Mushroom_Forest:0 "Mushroom Forests"

 Sandstorms:0 "Sandstorms"
 Sandstorms_desc:0 "On a windy day, giant, short lived walls of sand occasionally cover the surface with a thin layer of sand. Although these sandstorms happen quite frequently, they are more of an annoyance than a danger. A quick sweeping with a brush is enough to clean up any sand. With a bit of luck the next winds will just blow it all away again."
 
 Sand_Tornadoes:0 "Sand Tornadoes"
 Sand_Tornadoes_desc:0 "Occasionally sand tornadoes can be seen on this world. Though very small they usually happen in clusters of about three to seven depending on the terrain and direction of wind. The sand is fairly reflective which causes the sand tornadoes to almost shine in the sunlight. Very beautiful, albeit a bit chaotic, to see."
 
 Silicon_Crystals:0 "Silicon Crystals"
 Silicon_Crystals_desc:0 "Large silicon crystals are seen growing on this world. They seem to form clusters of crystals starting at a point in the soul and growing outwards like a flower. Their colours depend on the composition of the soil, with bright soil resulting in fairly clear yellow and brown crystals and darker, iron rich soil resulting in bright red or purple crystals. Various other types can be found across the surface of this world."
 
 Quicksand:0 "Quicksand"
 Quicksand_desc:0 "Large pools of loose soil on this world is seen to behave much like quicksand. Though unlike quicksand it doesn't always have to be wet, which makes it very deceptive and dangerous. Every step taken on this world has to be checked beforehand and routes have to be carefully mapped."

 ###### 5 cold exclusive modifiers ######

 Never_Ending_Aurora:0 "Never Ending Aurora"
 Never_Ending_Aurora_desc:0 "Because of this systems almost unique solar activity this world is blessed with a permanent display of auroras. These auroras are formed when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind to form charged particles that are visible. The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying colour and complexity."
 
 Spirals_of_Ice:0 "Spirals of Ice"
 Spirals_of_Ice_desc:0 "Very unusual features are found on this planet. The cold wind and moist air tend to form spirals of ice. Some of these spirals have grown so large they match our tallest buildings. It's remarkable how not a single crack can be found on them as well as no air bubbles which makes they crystal clear. During the night they reflect the galaxy's light in a beautiful display of colours."
 
 Furry_Packs:0 "Furry Packs"
 Furry_Packs_desc:0 "This world is inhabited by huge roaming packs of giant, four legged creatures. These creatures have massive hornes on their head and a long, and very nimble, extra arm as nose. They are covered in a thick, mostly brown fur to keep them warm during the nights. They seem to be a very social type of animal. It's not know how, but they seem to take the same route around the world looking for food every season. Perhaps they're just good at remembering the terrain they roam."
 
 Blizzards:0 "Blizzards"
 Blizzards_desc:0 "It always starts with light snowfall, but this world's weather always follows the same pattern. Light snow, heavy wind and in just a moment’s notice, it becomes a full-fledged blizzard. With snowfall so dense you can hardly see the end of your extremities."
 
 Abominable_Predators:0 "Abominable Predators"
 Abominable_Predators_desc:0 "On cold nights, this creature roams the lands looking for food. It's massive height and large forearms are a terrifying sight. While they don't hunt in packs they are seen to be living in small groups of around four to six. These creatures have a thick light-blue to white coat of fur and giant claws. It behaves almost apelike and has been observed to communicate through grunts and gestures with its fellow companions."

 Ecological_Nervous_System_desc:0 "The plant life on this world seems to be connected to each other through a complex root system. The energetic pulses that run through it is very reminiscent of a nervous system. Observations have found that killing one plant has an effect on nearby plants as they seem to close their flowers or slowly grow in the opposite direction."
 
 Carnivorous_Flies:0 "Carnivorous Flies"
 Carnivorous_Flies_desc:0 "These tiny flies may seem like just an annoyance, they are the most dangerous creatures on this world. These tiny flies glow in the dark at night, but that's not when they're out feeding. During the night they glow as a means to attract other flies as a part of their mating ritual, which seems to be quite complex. During the day they fly around looking for food. Being carnivorous, they tend to swarm their prey and eat it alive in a matter of hours. Large, or small, all creatures are food for them. What makes it even worse is their colony like behaviour, allowing them to navigate complex tunnels.. or vents! The fact that they emit no noise to even warn their next meal is the worst part."

The shiny hull that was showing isn't just a small crashed ship, it was just a single section of a much larger ship. A ship that was surprisingly still in one piece. After digging it out we discovered the reason it failed was a direct hit to its control centre which spend it spiralling down into the planet.

The tectonic plates on this world seem very stable; this is probably thanks to a few very large volcanoes that regularly release pressure that builds up beneath the plates. Further study will be required to see how the liquid mantle in such hot core planets interacts with the dense metal centre."

This world has just the right tectonic density to peer through with our scanners. We have fully mapped out the fluid interactions of this world core.\n The data suggest that around the dense metal core there is not one but two distinct layers of molten rock and minerals. The first, inner, layer seems to behave as normal, flowing against the dense metal core and producing it's magnetic field. The fluid inner layer seems to move at the speeds we expect it to move. The outer molten layer however seems to flow in the opposite direction of the inner layer at a much slower speed.\nThis creates unique convection currents that keep them from over pressurising the tectonic plates and turning this world into a geological unstable nightmare."
